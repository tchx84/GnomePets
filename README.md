Gnome Pets
==========

Because you surely need more distractions in life :) Why not having virtual pets playing around in your desktop!

# About This

Just a quick pet project for catching up with Gjs and Flatpak devel.

# TODO

* Replace Neko/cat sprite with a new one, so I can properly license this project.
* Don't display a maximized window, instead use a tiny window exclusively for the pet and capture global cursor events.
* Add support for multiple pets, and make these available as flatpak extensions.
* Provide other images like desktop icon, gnome-software thumbnails, etc.
